# Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction Using Graph Analytics

This project predicts drug-drug interactions (DDIs) using graph analytics and machine learning. It leverages data from DrugBank, PubChem, and STRING to build a heterogeneous graph and uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for prediction.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, graph construction, and model training.
- `frontend/`: Streamlit app for user interaction.
- `models/`: Trained models and weights.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/drug-drug-interaction.git
